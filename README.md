## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Details

### Supabase Integration

Supabase serves as the backbone for EchoMind‚Äôs backend, providing a PostgreSQL database, real-time subscriptions, and storage. Here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs implemented:

- **Database Schema**: Tables such as users, sessions, bookmarks, and tutors are defined in Supabase to store user data, session history, and tutor metadata. Row-Level Security (RLS) policies ensure users can only access their own data.
- **Real-Time Subscriptions**: Using Supabase‚Äôs real-time capabilities, EchoMind listens for updates to session data, enabling live updates for session history and user progress without manual refreshes.
- **Storage**: User-uploaded resources (e.g., study materials) are stored in Supabase Storage buckets, with access controlled via RLS policies.
- **API Integration**: Supabase‚Äôs auto-generated REST APIs are consumed in Next.js API routes to handle CRUD operations, ensuring a seamless data flow between the frontend and backend.

### Clerk Integration (Authentication & Billing)

Clerk powers EchoMind‚Äôs user management and billing workflows, providing a secure and developer-friendly solution:

- **Authentication**: Clerk‚Äôs prebuilt components (<SignIn /> and <SignUp />) are integrated into Next.js pages for user authentication. Google OAuth is enabled for social login, with Clerk handling token management and session persistence. The useUser hook provides access to user data across the app.
- **Using Junie for Clerk Authentication**: JetBrains‚Äô AI coding agent, Junie, was used to streamline Clerk‚Äôs authentication setup. With a prompt like "Implement Clerk authentication with Google OAuth in my Next.js project," Junie automated the installation of @clerk/nextjs, configured environment variables, set up middleware for route protection, and integrated sign-up/sign-in components. It also generated tests to verify the authentication flow, ensuring seamless integration with EchoMind‚Äôs architecture.
- **Billing & Subscriptions**: Clerk‚Äôs subscription management integrates with Stripe to handle payments. Subscription plans are defined in Clerk‚Äôs dashboard, and the <PricingTable /> component is used to display plans and handle upgrades/downgrades. Webhooks from Clerk and Stripe are processed in Next.js API routes to sync subscription status with Supabase, ensuring access control based on user tiers.

### Vapi Integration

Vapi enables EchoMind‚Äôs voice-driven learning sessions with AI-powered tutors:

- **Voice Agents**: Vapi‚Äôs API is used to create conversational AI agents specializing in various subjects. The NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_WEB_TOKEN is used to authenticate API requests, and agents are configured with custom voices, languages, and conversational styles.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Vapi‚Äôs low-latency speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities are integrated into the frontend using WebRTC, allowing users to interact with tutors via voice in real time.
- **Session Management**: Session data (e.g., conversation transcripts) is stored in Supabase, with Vapi‚Äôs API providing endpoints to start, stop, and manage sessions. The frontend uses React state to handle session lifecycle events.
